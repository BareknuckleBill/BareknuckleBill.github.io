                <summary>GRU Background & Transfer Notes</summary>
                <p><span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span> enlisted in the Russian Armed Forces in 2016 at age 18. Described as precise, cold, and unnervingly efficient, he displayed:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A complete lack of emotional engagement</li>
                    <li>Extreme discipline and impulse control</li>
                    <li>Lethal precision at extreme distances</li>
                    <li>Systematic application of violence</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Recognized for improbable long-range shots, he was earmarked by GRU. By 2018, he joined GRU Spetsnaz, assigned to the 294th Detachment, earning the nickname "Scalpel" for his surgical precision. Reassigned to BEAR for Norvinsk operations against USEC and Terra Group, he operates autonomously under high-command orders.</p>

                <summary>Callsign Origin - "Scalpel"</summary>
                <p>Originated during a GRU overwatch mission with a 1712m shot through a convoy's driver-side viewport, severing the target's spine without harming the passenger. Squadmate remarked, "He didn’t shoot. He fucking cut. That wasn’t a bullet — that was a scalpel." Another noted, "It’s like watching a computer squeeze the trigger." An officer, shaken, said, "He’s not human... if you’re in his crosshairs, you’re a dead man walking." The nickname spread and became official among ranks.</p>

                <p>Despite complaints of coldness and unsettling demeanor, <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span>’s 0% failure rate and 118+ confirmed kills outweigh concerns. Command rebuts psychological reports unless linked to performance degradation. Verdict: Continue deployment.</p>

                <summary>Psychological Evaluation</summary>
                <p><strong>Conducted by: Dr. Natalia Mirova</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Status:</strong> Active Deployment Approved</p>
                <p><strong>Profile:</strong> High-functioning – Strategic Asset</p>
                <p><span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span> exhibits pronounced sociopathic markers, characterized by complete emotional detachment, negligible empathy, and hyper-logical cognitive processing. These traits are not only adaptive but appear optimized for his role as a precision instrument in high-stakes operations. He perceives individuals, including himself, as operational variables, assigned weighted values based on utility to the mission objective. Emotional concepts such as loyalty, camaraderie, or morality are irrelevant to his decision-making framework, which prioritizes measurable outcomes over subjective considerations.</p>
                <p><strong>Behavioral Analysis:</strong> <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span> maintains an unnervingly consistent demeanor, marked by minimal verbal interaction and an absence of emotional fluctuation. His speech, when required, is devoid of embellishment, focusing solely on operational clarity and precision. Colleagues report discomfort in his presence, describing his silence as "oppressive" and his gaze as "mechanical." This psychological impact, while unintentional, amplifies his effectiveness in sowing unease among both allies and enemies. During debriefs, he corrects inaccuracies with clinical precision, dismissing emotional or speculative input as "noise." His refusal to engage in non-essential dialogue reinforces his isolation from team dynamics, though this appears deliberate to maintain operational focus.</p>
                <p><strong>Cognitive Processing:</strong> <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span> processes information through a rigid, hierarchical framework: utility, probability, response threshold, and consequence. Emotional or ethical considerations are systematically excluded, treated as variables that could compromise efficiency. For example, in a hypothetical scenario involving a compromised squadmate, he stated he would "remove the cause of the compromise" post-mission, viewing the individual as a liability rather than a person. This utilitarian approach extends to his own survival, which he evaluates solely in terms of mission success, showing no attachment to self-preservation beyond its tactical necessity.</p>
                <p><strong>Stress Response:</strong> Under extreme conditions, <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span> displays no observable signs of stress, fear, or hesitation. Psychological tests indicate an extraordinary capacity for compartmentalization, with no evidence of trauma, guilt, or psychological fatigue despite prolonged exposure to high-intensity combat. His ability to maintain focus during extended overwatch (e.g., 11-hour prone waits) suggests a cognitive resilience that borders on inhuman. This lack of emotional response extends to lethal actions, which he describes as "mechanical adjustments to the operational equation."</p>
                <p><strong>Interpersonal Impact:</strong> <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span>’s detachment creates a ripple effect, unsettling less experienced operatives. Squad reports note his presence as a "force multiplier through fear," not only for enemies but occasionally for allies, who perceive his lack of empathy as unnatural. However, this aligns with his strategic role, as his reputation enhances psychological warfare efforts. His interactions with command are minimal, accepting orders without question but providing feedback only when it improves mission parameters. He shows no interest in recognition, viewing it as an inefficient variable that "adds weight without value."</p>
                <p><strong>Risk Assessment:</strong> While <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span>’s psychological profile is stable for current operations, long-term risks include potential over-reliance on his autonomy and the possibility of undetected cognitive degradation due to his extreme compartmentalization. Subtle shifts in efficiency metrics should be monitored, as emotional indicators are unreliable in his case. His lack of social integration poses no immediate operational risk but may complicate future team-based assignments.</p>
                <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Continue field assignment in Norvinsk AO. Operational success (0% failure rate, 118+ confirmed kills) significantly outweighs social dysfunction. Mandate quarterly psychological evaluations to monitor for performance degradation, focusing on data-driven metrics rather than subjective reports. Avoid integrating into conventional units to preserve his effectiveness as a solitary asset.</p>

                <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unmatched autonomous asset; measure via field reports and enemy behavioral shifts.</li>
                    <li>Avoid overuse to preserve mental stability; monitor via data, not mood.</li>

                    <li>Avoid routine taskings; focus on strategic narrative ends.</li>
