    </div>

    <div class="section-title">A Note From The Author</div>
    
    <p>This account is offered with humility and the full weight of retrospect. At the time of writing this field report, I was twenty-five years old—young, entitled, arrogant, and astoundingly ignorant of my own limitations. I was foolish in the purest sense: the kind of foolishness that carries with it the illusion of mastery, the delusion of infallibility.</p>

    <p>I overstated my capabilities, believed myself an authority on nearly every topic, and paraded my degree from the Maxim Gorky Literature Institute as if it were divine proof of expertise. I apologise to those who knew me then—for my insufferable condescension—and most of all:</p>

    <p class="emphasis">To the hunter who appears later in this account:</p>

    <p>You, more than anyone, deserved far better than the total arrogance, sheer disrespect, and blatant ignorance I brought to that encounter. I owe you far more than any words can express—your unyielding patience, your quiet vigilance, and total refusal to turn away from a stranger too foolish to know the danger he was in.—For this, I thank you. I am sorry for that, and the fact that I do not possess the words to express such reverence and gratitude that I hold for you; purely for the undeserving kindness you showed on that day.</p>

    <p>Without your intervention, without the steadiness and kindness you undeservingly showed me?</p>

    <p>I'd have ended up at the base of the birch tree.</p>

    <p>The one that sits just outside of my home.</p>

    <p>The birch tree closest to my house, yet still within the Taiga's side of the wood line.</p>

    <p>You could have said nothing, and continued as though it was irrelevant.</p>

    <p>I wouldn't have blamed you if you did. You could have allowed things to run their course, and allowed me to tread that path which led to the base of that birch tree outside my home. But, you did not.</p>

    <p>That birch tree. The one which serves as my own personal monolith of remembrance to you, and your deeds on that day.</p>

    <p>As much as it is a pillar of remembrance, it is also the Taiga's ever-watching reminder:</p>

    <p>As much as I watch it—</p>

    <p>It too, watches me.</p>

    <p>It never forgets anything.</p>

    <p class="emphasis">Thank you, Hunter.<br>
    Thank you, for everything.</p>

    <div class="section-title">Field Account</div>

    <p>What follows is the first formal record of the folk rhyme known as "Death By A Leap". While I originally documented the rhyme and included it in a now out-of-print regional compendium of Far Eastern folklore, I deliberately withheld the full account of what I experienced—and the deeper truths conveyed to me by the local hunter who shared the rhyme's origin. At the time, I was still wrestling with the implications of what I'd learned.</p>

    <p>This report, then, is not merely academic. It is personal. It documents not just a rhyme, but the living tradition and metaphysical framework surrounding the entity invoked by that verse—a tradition passed to me not by books or lectures, but through the solemn instruction of a man who lived its reality.</p>

    <p>In 1998, while attempting to establish myself as a published folklorist under an independent imprint, I travelled to the Khabarovsk Khai region. I had, two years prior, graduated from the Maxim Gorky Literature Institute—barely. My academic record was middling; my personal discipline, worse. I had scraped through thanks to my parents' support and a great deal of undeserved leniency.</p>

    <p>At that time, I fancied myself a man of letters and insisted on being referred to as a "scholar." I corrected those who addressed me otherwise, believing my education granted me unquestionable authority. It did not.</p>

    <p>I had begun seeing a woman who was introduced to me through a mutual friend. She was articulate, composed, and an excellent target shooter—a hobby she pursued with confidence and skill. She was also, frankly, stunning, and I was desperate to impress her.</p>

    <p>During one of our early conversations, I told her—without any truth to the matter—that I owned a firearm and was a seasoned shooter myself. This was a lie, told entirely to bolster my self-image. I followed it up with a rushed application for a firearm license and a trip to a local gun shop in Khabarovsk.</p>

    <p>There, I attempted to dazzle the owner with an utterly fabricated story about my experience. I assumed he would be impressed and give me a premium rifle at a discount. He wasn't fooled. But instead of calling me out, he humoured me. He praised my "expertise" and sold me a serviceable <em>Izhmash Los-7-1 in 7.62x54R</em>—a perfectly fine rifle, just not the elite weapon I thought I'd tricked him into handing over.</p>

    <p>The woman saw through me just as easily. We went to the range once, and I embarrassed myself thoroughly. Later, she told me—privately and kindly—that had I been honest and less full of myself, I might actually be worth talking to. That stung. I didn't see her again.</p>

    <p>Despite this, I kept the rifle. I even began practicing—sporadically—at the range. And then, in 1998, I decided I was ready to hunt. I phoned the same mutual friend and asked if he knew of any guided hunts in the region. I dressed it up as a casual inquiry but insisted that I was already an "experienced shooter with hunting experience."</p>

    <p>He laughed.</p>

    <p>Knowing full well that I was neither of those things, he recommended a local hunter—a quiet man who lived just outside Novy Urgal, right near the edge of the taiga. He assured me the man was experienced, capable, and trustworthy. The hunter wouldn't charge me anything if we brought something back and he kept it. If not, I was to offer him cash and food in return for the time.</p>

    <p>Before hanging up, my friend added a warning: "He's got his own little ways about him." I scoffed. My friend clarified—he's superstitious, lives with his dog near the forest, and rarely speaks unless necessary. I cracked a joke about Father Christmas. My friend offered a polite, tired laugh. "Just do what he says," he told me.</p>

    <p>I called the hunter. He answered with silence. After I introduced myself and referenced our mutual connection, he acknowledged me and confirmed the arrangement. We agreed to meet at a local hunting shop on the outskirts of Novy Urgal. He was explicit: <span class="emphasis">Do not enter the forest until I arrive. Wait in the car park.</span></p>

    <p>Three days later, I drove out. I parked—at the wrong shop, just a few minutes down the road—and after growing impatient, I took my gear and entered the woods alone. I wandered aimlessly for ten or fifteen minutes before a voice behind me called out.</p>

    <p>It was the hunter.</p>

    <p>He looked at me with steady eyes and said, <span class="emphasis">"You've got your rifle, and you're in the woods."</span> Then he paused, as if trying to figure something out, the weight of his gaze growing heavier. That silence stretched between us, and I felt a rising tide of panic and uncertainty pressing down on me.</p>

    <p>Finally, he continued, <span class="emphasis">"Before you entered with it, — Did you ask for permission to enter, and greet the woods?"</span></p>

    <p>His words hung in the cold air like a challenge.</p>

    <p>My hands trembled slightly as I reached out for his cracked leather notebook. My throat tightened. I could feel the sweat prickling at the nape of my neck, heart hammering erratically beneath my ribs. Every muscle in my body seemed to tense, caught between dread and curiosity. I read the rhyme aloud, my voice barely steady, faltering on some of the words. When I finished, I lowered the notebook slowly and spoke my apology—genuine, solemn, and thick with regret.</p>

    <p>The hunter watched me closely the entire time. His eyes never wavered. There was concern etched deep into his features, but after my apology, I noticed a subtle shift—an almost imperceptible easing of his expression, as if to silently say that, for now, it was sufficient.</p>

    <p>From that point on, the dynamic shifted. My arrogance gave way to unease. I followed his lead.</p>

    <p>As we continued through the taiga, I began to feel something I could not immediately name—an intangible weight pressing just behind my thoughts. A vague, persistent tension that gnawed at the edge of my awareness. I had no language for it then, only an instinctual understanding that I had done something I should not have. I could not say what, only that I had erred. That quiet guilt stalked me through every tree-lined corridor we crossed, until I began to dread the sound of my own footfall.</p>

    <p>Later that day, I managed—by some miracle—to bring down an elk. The hunter carried most of the weight back to his homestead.</p>

    <p>But I could not shake what I'd felt. The hunter's gaze—steady, ancient, weighed with knowledge—remained etched into my thoughts. I saw it each time I blinked. His question repeated itself in my mind like a drumbeat: <em>You've got your rifle, and you're in the woods. Before you entered with it, — Did you ask for permission to enter, and greet the woods?</em></p>

    <p>After our exchange and the final recitation of the rhyme, I found the second time no different. I found it odd, and unnerving. In any case, I found myself still holding the antlers I had recovered earlier. Their weight now felt different—not physical, but symbolic.</p>

    <p>I looked at them for a long while, then finally asked, "Would it be alright if I kept these?"</p>

    <p>The hunter tilted his head, his gaze unreadable. "Are they important to you?"</p>

    <p>I nodded. "Yes. They are."</p>

    <p>He studied me in silence, only breaking it to ask a seemingly odd question,</p>

    <p>"Is there a birch tree near your home?"</p>

    <p>I hesitated, confused, but answered, "Yes. One just at the edge of the woods. Closest to the house."</p>

    <p>He gave a solemn nod. "Take them with you and then place the antlers at its base. Before you sleep."</p>

    <p>I frowned. "Why? What does that do?"</p>

    <p>The hunter didn't answer directly. Instead, he said, "If you wake up tomorrow and find a blackened piece of birch in your pocket... come back here. I will tell you what I know."</p>

    <p>I left soon after. As I made my way back through the taiga, the forest felt... changed. Not overtly hostile, but undeniably watchful. The silence had grown thick again, pressing against my back.</p>

    <p>That evening, I placed the antlers gently at the base of the birch tree outside my home, just as he instructed. I went inside, locked the door, and lay in bed with a thousand questions circling in my head. Sleep came slowly. Restlessly.</p>

    <p>When I awoke the next morning, groggy and unrested, I got up. I dressed myself and pulled on my coat to start a fire.</p>

    <p>That's when I felt it—a small, hardened shape in my pocket.</p>

    <p>I drew it out with trembling fingers: a blackened chunk of birch.</p>

    <p>Recalling my question yesterday, I set off immediately to get answers. I drove those two hours, questions spinning around my head faster than I could think about them.</p>

    <p>In my lack of concentration, I returned to a different spot entirely to the day prior. Despite this, the hunter was there. Waiting for me. I produced the piece of blackened birch, to which the hunter turned and walked back into the woods.</p>

    <p>I followed him to his cabin.</p>

    <p>True to his word, he explained everything.</p>

    <p>I recorded the rhyme, which was later published in a book. It wasn't a bestseller, but that didn't matter.</p>

    <p>That day marked the end of who I had been.</p>

    <p>I never saw the hunter again.</p>

    <p>But I still have the blackened piece of birch. I keep it as a reminder.</p>

    <p>What began as a foolish lie and a reckless journey transformed into something I could never have foreseen. I changed my ways. I learned—truly learned—what folklore is, and what it carries. Not just stories, but weight. Meaning. Danger.</p>

    <p>Since then, I have devoted myself wholly to the study of regional folk belief, superstition, and ritual. I owe my life—and my career as a legitimised scholar—to that hunter's patience and quiet generosity. Without him, I would not be writing any of this. I hope he is well and hold him in my thoughts.</p>

    <div class="poem-title">"Death By A Leap"</div>

    <div class="poem">
        Taiga vast, so deep and old,<br>
        I step with reverence, quiet and bold.<br>
        Before I enter, I bow my head,<br>
        Speak words of respect for your paths I tread.<br><br>

        <em>"Taiga Forest, I greet you now,<br>
        May I enter, is a hunt allowed?"</em><br><br>

        Leaves may whisper, shadows creep,<br>
        I've asked permission—before I leap.<br>
        Guide my steps, aim steady and true,<br>
        Let the hunt be fair, the balance is due.<br><br>

        Wild Taiga, please hear my plea,<br>
        Allow me to take, only what I need.<br>
        With solemn heart, I swear this now,<br>
        I stand upon your hallowed ground.<br><br>

        If I break your sacred laws, I forfeit my life,<br>
        Take it, it's yours.<br>
        Take my life, watch high from a perch,<br>
        Lie my body at the base of a birch.<br><br>

        Lie me there, near my home,<br>
        Let me rot, right down to the bone.<br>
        I say this now, I abide by law,<br>
        I say this now, and will forever more.

            <p style="margin: 5px 0 0 0; font-size: 13px; color: #444;">Using this for my thesis on Siberian oral traditions. The rhyme structure is consistent with other documented forest rituals from the region.</p>
